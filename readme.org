I've been using this wonderful editor every day since May 2024, so I couldn't help but make a org exclusively for it.

* Table of contents

- [[#Language-support][Language Support]]
- [[#Installation][Installation]]
- [[#Keymaps][Keymaps]]

** Language support

- [x] Haskell
- [x] Lisp
- [x] Java
- [x] Html/Css
- [ ] C/C++

** Installation

To install it, it's very simple, just clone this repository in your home folder, like this example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/bgc-emacs/bgc-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

* Keymaps

For keymaps we use the xah-fly-keys qwerty-abnt layout, but it can be easily changed in /elisp/init-xah-fly.el
